5. Clone the repository
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/SqlScriptDOM
    ```
    
#### macOS/Linux

4. Clone the repository
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/SqlScriptDOM
    ```

### Building

Navigate to the root of the source code:
```cmd
cd SqlScriptDOM
```

Optional, Windows-only - Generate and open Visual Studio solution. This step is not required to build the project.
```cmd
slngen
```

Restore project dependencies:
```cmd
dotnet restore
```

To build:
```cmd
dotnet build
```



### Running the tests

You can run tests directly in Visual Studio Text Explorer or by using the ```dotnet test``` command.

Example: To run all priority 0 tests
```cmd
dotnet test --filter Priority=0
```

### Pull Request Process

Before sending a Pull Request, please do the following:

1. Ensure builds are still successful and tests, including any added or updated tests, pass prior to submitting the pull request.
2. Update any documentation, user and contributor, that is impacted by your changes.
3. Include your change description in `CHANGELOG.md` file as part of pull request.
4. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Helpful notes for SQLDOM extensions

1. For changing the DOM classes, modify the XML file (the C# code is generated based on this during the build process) `$(EnlistmentRoot)\Source\SqlDom\SqlScriptDom\Parser\TSql\Ast.xml`. Change Ast.xml to put the class pieces on their appropriate statements.
    1. The build process is defined in `$(EnlistmentRoot)\Source\SqlDom\SqlScriptDom\SqlScriptDom.props` (Target Name="CreateAST")
    2. The generated files are dropped in `$(EnlistmentRoot)\obj\<x64|x86>\<Debug|Release>\SqlScriptDom.csproj\`
   
2. For changing the parser, modify the .g file here:
`$(EnlistmentRoot)\Source\SqlDom\SqlScriptDom\Parser\TSql\TSql<#>.g` where # is the version (ie - 100, 120, 130). This will usually be the latest number if adding new grammar. Change the Tsql(xxx).g file to parse the new syntax.
    1. The build process is defined in `$(EnlistmentRoot)\Source\SqlDom\SqlScriptDom\SqlScriptDom.props` (Target Name="CreateAST")
    2. The generated files are dropped in `$(EnlistmentRoot)\obj\x86|x64\Debug|Release\sqlscriptdom.csproj\`

3. For changing the ScriptGenerator, modify the appropriate file (i.e. Visitor that accepts the modified DOM class) in here: `$(EnlistmentRoot)\Source\SqlDom\SqlScriptDom\ScriptDom\SqlServer\ScriptGenerator`.
    1. To add a new ScriptGenerator, you need to add the file to `$(EnlistmentRoot)\Source\SqlDom\SqlScriptDom\SqlScriptDom.props`
    1. Change The visitors SqlScriptGenerator.X to use the new piece from AST.XML
    1. If you're adding syntax that's Azure-only or Standalone-only, implement appropriate Versioning Visitor for your constructs.

4. When adding/removing new files please add/remove an entry to/from `$(EnlistmentRoot)\Source\SqlDom\SqlScriptDom\SqlScriptDom.csproj` 

5. To extend the tests do the following:
    1. Baselines# needs to be updated or added with the appropriate .sql file as expected results.
    1. The Only#SyntaxTests.cs needs to be extended or added to specify the appropriate TestScripts script.
    1. Positive tests go in Only#SyntaxTests.cs if adding new grammar.
    1. Create a \TestScripts script that is the input for the test. (This is what is run and is checked against the .sql files in Baselines#)
    1. Negative tests go in ParserErrorsTests.cs.
